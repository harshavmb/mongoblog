# mongoblog
It is a personal blog built on top of MongoDB

I started developing this blog when I'm getting trained in MongoDB by MongoDB University.

Have customized it by adding Twitter Bootstrap UI, about & contact pages, few extra forms. 

Few salient features:

1) Responsive design using Twitter bootstrap

2) Social plugins in the footer

3) Flexible schema design with MongoDB (hosted on MongoLabs)

4) Admin can add fully functional html post (by logging in) and page will be rendered without distortion

5) Static content hosted on google drive for faster loading
